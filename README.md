# Pentesting-On-Coldbox-
Introduction : The "Pentesting on ColdBox" project was initiated to assess the security of a ColdBox application and identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The project involved a comprehensive testing methodology that included both automated and manual techniques, such as vulnerability scanning, web application firewall testing, and source code analysis. The purpose of this testing was to identify weaknesses in the application's security posture and provide actionable recommendations for remediation.During the testing process, several vulnerabilities were discovered in the ColdBox application, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session fixation. These vulnerabilities were analyzed to determine their potential impact on the application and to recommend appropriate mitigation strategies. For example, to address the SQL injection vulnerability, it was recommended that the application implement parameterized queries to prevent untrusted input from being executed as SQL commands.Overall, the project provided valuable insights into the security posture of the ColdBox application and highlighted the importance of ongoing security testing and risk management. By identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities, the project helped to reduce the risk of a successful cyber attack on the application, protecting both the organization and its users. The recommendations provided by the project can serve as a roadmap for improving the overall security posture of the ColdBox application and can be used to guide future security testing efforts
